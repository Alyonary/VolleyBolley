# FAQ

## Registration
To find the right games and teammates, choose your current skill level:

### Options:
- **Light (L1-L3)**: Beginner  
- **Medium (M1-M3)**: Confident amateur  
- **Hard (H1-H3)**: Advanced  
- **Pro (P1-P3)**: Professional  

The higher the number, the higher the skill. Your level may change later based on player ratings.

## Post-Game Ratings
After each game, teammates can rate your level.  
Once you receive 6 ratings, your level may change:

- **6 positive ratings → promoted one step**  
- **6 negative ratings → demoted one step**  
- **Mixed feedback → level stays the same**
